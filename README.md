# C.L Zengâ€™s dotfiles

It's just a dotfile for myself used.  
I also write an Install.sh for the deploy workspace phases, if you give these dotfiles a try, Please fork this repository.

## Installation

**Warning:** Plaese review the Install.sh before perform it.  
  
The script will check the dotfiles which previously existed,  
if the file type is 'file', then backup to the Backup folder.  
or the file type is 'symbolic link', it will detemeter the real path, then ask action to you.  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Calvin-Zeng/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles && sh Install.sh
```
