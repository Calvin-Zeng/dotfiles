I was created two files in this directory intentionally, because the directory will link to the $HOME/.vim, not linked files.  
and, I ignore the autoload / colors / plugged directorys in .gitignore.  
so, the all of .vim files will stored in this repository directory.  
  
I have know the --no-folding option, but I don't want use this option during run stow.
